### Q: Who should attend this tutorial?

This tutorial is designed for researchers and practitioners interested in AI alignment, safety, and ethics. We will explore how concepts from economics, political theory, law, and cultural evolution can inform AI alignment beyond simple preference learning. The tutorial aims to focus on the fundamental question of *"how can we live together?"* where “we” includes people with whom we may personally disagree about the common good and where there are challenges of incentivizing and coordinating a highly diverse population in decisions about where to allocate resources, what information to extract, and how to balance self-interest and the interests of others.
